In-Class Activities 1-1
Using a wireframe/mockup tool, design sketch layouts similar to attached images.

These are smaller in-module exercises designed to give you a chance to work on what you have just learned or to answer some basic questions on what you've just learned and are important for the learning process. 

ICAs can be very helpful in demonstrating your web page design skills.


Although it is important to understand the concepts behind every technology, no amount of theory can improve on real-world experience. To this end, each class includes In-Class Activities (ICA) Projects that provide you with practice implementing technology skills in real-world situations. Each project is a standalone project, giving you a wide variety of topics and difficulty levels.

â€¢ Using a wireframe tool, design sketch layouts similar to attached images:
3_video_store_desktop_view
8_video_store_mobile_view

Save files as 3_video_store_desktop_view_yourname and 8_video_store_mobile_view_yourname


In-Class Activities are for practice purposes only and are not part of any assignments.

Note that you will continue to improve your design in future classes.
