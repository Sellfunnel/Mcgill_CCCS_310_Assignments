Class Activities 2

These are smaller in-module exercises designed to give you a chance to work on what you have just learned or to answer some basic questions on what you've just learned and are important for the learning process. 

Class Activities Exercises can be very helpful in demonstrating your web page design skills.

Design the Central Valley Farmers Market (central-valley.html) web page. Make sure it looks close to the screenshot.

Note that you will continue to improve your design in future classes.
